SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com

# Where to send notifications
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
```

## 📝 Setup Steps

### For Gmail (Recommended):

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification**
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/security

2. **Generate App Password**
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" and "Other"
   - Copy the 16-character password

3. **Update .env file**
   - Copy settings from `.env.example`
   - Use your Gmail address in `SMTP_USER`
   - Use the app password (not your regular password) in `SMTP_PASS`
   - Set `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` to where you want to receive notifications

4. **Restart Server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

### Verify Email Configuration
```bash
cd backend
node -e "require('./services/emailService').verifyEmailConfig().then(console.log)"
```

### Test with Real Submission
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/contacts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
