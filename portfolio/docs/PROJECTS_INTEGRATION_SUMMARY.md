---

## Component Structure

### ProjectsSection Component
```tsx
<ProjectsSection 
  showHeader={true}      // Show title and description
  showFilter={true}      // Show category filter tabs
  showStats={true}       // Show stats section
  showCTA={true}         // Show call-to-action section
/>
```

### Props Available
- `showHeader?: boolean` - Toggle header section (default: true)
- `showFilter?: boolean` - Toggle category filter (default: true)
- `showStats?: boolean` - Toggle stats section (default: true)
- `showCTA?: boolean` - Toggle CTA section (default: true)

## Page Structure (Home Page)

```
Home Page
├── Hero Section
├── About Section
├── Skills Section
├── Projects Section  ← NEW! Full featured
│   ├── Header (title + description)
│   ├── Category Filter (All/Frontend/Backend)
│   ├── Projects Grid (9 projects)
│   ├── View More/Less (mobile only)
│   ├── Stats Cards
│   └── Call to Action
└── Contact Preview Section
```

---

## Features Active on Home Page

All features are now available:

**9 Project Cards** (3 Frontend + 6 Backend)
**Category Filtering** (All, Frontend, Backend)
**Mobile Optimization** (3 projects initially, View More/Less buttons)
**Smooth Animations** (Scroll reveals, hover effects)
**Responsive Grid** (1/2/3 columns)
**Stats Section** (Total, Frontend, Backend counts)
**CTA Section** (Get in Touch + GitHub links)
**Dark Mode Support**
**Performance Optimized** (Lazy loading, smooth scrolling)

---

## How It Works

### Home Page (`/`)
- Displays full Projects section with all features
- Positioned between Skills and Contact sections
- Uses scroll-based animations (whileInView)
- Mobile users see 3 projects initially with View More button

### Projects Page (`/projects`)
- Standalone dedicated page for projects
- Same component with all features enabled
- Wrapped in Section component for consistency
- Users can access via navigation menu

---

## User Experience

### Desktop/Tablet Users
1. Navigate to home page
2. Scroll down past Hero, About, and Skills
3. See full Projects section with all 9 projects
4. Filter by category if desired
5. View stats and CTA section

### Mobile Users
1. Navigate to home page
2. Scroll down to Projects section
3. See first 3 projects
4. Click "View More Projects" to expand
5. Click "View Less" to collapse (scrolls to top)
6. Filter by category (auto-resets to 3 projects)

---

## Animation Behavior

### Scroll-Based Animations
- Uses `whileInView` instead of `animate` for lazy triggering
- Animations only play when section enters viewport
- Better performance on initial page load
- `viewport={{ once: true }}` prevents re-triggering

### Key Differences from Standalone Page
- **Home Page**: Animations trigger on scroll (whileInView)
- **Projects Page**: Animations trigger on mount (animate)

---

## Customization Options

### Show Only Grid (No Header/Filter)
```tsx
<ProjectsSection 
  showHeader={false}
  showFilter={false}
  showStats={false}
  showCTA={false}
/>
```

### Featured Projects Only (Future)
You can modify to show featured projects:
```tsx
const featuredProjects = PROJECTS.filter(p => p.featured);
```

### Custom Grid (Future Enhancement)
Pass custom project list as prop:
```tsx
<ProjectsSection projects={customProjects} />
```

## Testing Checklist

Test on Home page:

- [ ] Projects section appears after Skills section
- [ ] All 9 projects display correctly
- [ ] Category filter works (All/Frontend/Backend)
- [ ] Animations trigger when scrolling to section
- [ ] Mobile: Shows 3 projects + View More button
- [ ] Mobile: View More expands to show all
- [ ] Mobile: View Less collapses and scrolls to top
- [ ] Stats section shows correct counts
- [ ] CTA buttons link to correct pages
- [ ] Dark mode works correctly
- [ ] Responsive on all screen sizes

Test on Projects page (`/projects`):

- [ ] Standalone page loads correctly
- [ ] All features work same as home page

- [ ] Can be accessed directly via URL

---

## Performance Impact

### Home Page Load
- **Before**: Placeholder text only
- **After**: Full projects section with 9 cards
- **Impact**: +2-3KB (gzipped), lazy loading helps
- **UX**: Significantly improved, complete showcase

### Mobile Performance
- **Initial**: 3 cards rendered (66% fewer DOM nodes)
- **Expanded**: All 9 cards rendered
- **Smooth**: Scroll animations don't block UI

## Route Structure

```

## Benefits of This Approach

### Flexibility
- Props allow customization per use case
- Can show full or partial features
- Easy to add to other pages

### Performance
- Lazy scroll animations on home page

## Next Steps

### Optional Enhancements
1. **Add Animation Delays**: Stagger section appearance on home page
2. **Intersection Observer**: More granular scroll detection
3. **Filter Persistence**: Remember user's last category choice
4. **Quick View Modal**: Click project for detail view
5. **Search Feature**: Add search bar above filter

### Content Updates
1. Update project descriptions
2. Add real GitHub URLs
3. Add live site URLs
4. Optimize project images
5. Add more projects as completed

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Home Page)
```tsx
import { ProjectsSection } from '../components/sections/ProjectsSection';

export const Home = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Hero />
      <About />
      <Skills />
      <ProjectsSection />  {/* All features enabled by default */}
      <Contact />
    </>
  );
};
```

### Custom Configuration
```tsx
<ProjectsSection 
  showHeader={true}
  showFilter={true}
  showStats={false}    // Hide stats
  showCTA={false}      // Hide CTA
/>
```

### Minimal Version (Grid Only)
```tsx
<ProjectsSection 
  showHeader={false}
  showFilter={false}
  showStats={false}
  showCTA={false}
/>
```
