# Deploying to Vercel

This guide will help you deploy your portfolio to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

- A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup) (free)
- Your portfolio code pushed to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket

## Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Import your project to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect it as a Vite project

3. **Configure the project**
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite
   - **Root Directory**: `portfolio`
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build` (auto-detected)
   - **Output Directory**: `dist` (auto-detected)
   - **Install Command**: `npm install` (auto-detected)

4. **Environment Variables** (if needed)
   - No environment variables are required since there's no backend
   - If you add them later, go to Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will build and deploy your site
   - You'll get a live URL like `https://your-portfolio.vercel.app`

### Method 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Navigate to your portfolio directory**
   ```bash
   cd portfolio
   ```

3. **Login to Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
   
   For production deployment:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Configuration Files

The following files have been configured for Vercel deployment:

### `vercel.json`
- Configures SPA routing (all routes redirect to index.html)
- Sets up caching headers for optimal performance
- Adds security headers

### `.env.production`
- Production environment variables
- No backend API URL since there's no backend

### `.gitignore`
- Excludes Vercel-specific files from version control

## Post-Deployment

### Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Click "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain and follow DNS setup instructions

### Automatic Deployments
- Every push to your `main` branch will trigger a new deployment
- Preview deployments are created for pull requests

### Build Logs
- View build logs in the Vercel dashboard
- Troubleshoot any deployment issues

## Project Structure

```
portfolio/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                 # Source code
â”œâ”€â”€ public/              # Static assets
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/                # Build output (auto-generated)
â”œâ”€â”€ vercel.json          # Vercel configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.production      # Production environment variables
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.ts       # Vite configuration
â””â”€â”€ package.json         # Dependencies and scripts
```

## Important Notes

1. **No Backend**: This is a frontend-only deployment. The admin features require a backend API to function.

2. **Admin Routes**: The admin login and dashboard routes are included but won't work without a backend API. Consider:
   - Removing admin routes if not needed
   - Deploying a separate backend API
   - Using a headless CMS or serverless functions

3. **Image Optimization**: Images in `src/assets/images/` are automatically optimized during build

4. **Performance**: The site uses:
   - Code splitting for optimal load times
   - Asset caching for faster subsequent visits
   - Lazy loading for images

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Test build locally: `npm run build`

### 404 Errors on Refresh
- This is handled by `vercel.json` rewrites
- All routes redirect to `index.html` for client-side routing

### Environment Variables Not Working
- Ensure variables are prefixed with `VITE_`
- Add them in Vercel Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables
- Redeploy after adding variables

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Test production build locally
npm run build
npm run preview

# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run type-check

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format
```

## Support

For Vercel-specific issues, check:
- [Vercel Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs)
- [Vite Deployment Guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html)
- [Your Project Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)

## Next Steps

After deployment:
1. âœ… Test all pages and routes
2. âœ… Verify images load correctly
3. âœ… Check responsive design on mobile devices
4. âœ… Test performance with Lighthouse
5. âœ… Set up analytics (optional)
6. âœ… Add custom domain (optional)
