## What Changed

Added **smooth slide-in animations** when switching between project categories (All, Frontend, Backend).

## 🎬 Animation Features

### When You Click a Category:

1. **Button Pulses** 
   - Active button briefly grows (1 → 1.08 → 1)
   - Gradient background slides smoothly

2. **Projects Slide Out**
   - Current projects slide to the right
   - Fade out + scale down
   - Exit in reverse order (last card first)
   - Duration: 0.3s

3. **New Projects Slide In**
   - New projects slide in from the left
   - Fade in + scale up
   - Staggered appearance (80ms between cards)
   - Duration: 0.5s
